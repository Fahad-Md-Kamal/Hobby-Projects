# (Hobby Project) #1 Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

This project involves building a real-time monitoring dashboard using FastAPI, Kafka, ZooKeeper, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

Here are the steps to get started:

### Setting Up the Environment

Install and configure Kafka, ZooKeeper, Elasticsearch, and Kibana in your development environment or on a cloud platform of your choice.
Make sure you have Python and FastAPI installed.

### Generating Sample Data:

Create a Kafka topic for receiving sample data. You can name it something like "monitoring-data-topic."

Write a Python script to generate sample monitoring data (e.g., server performance metrics like CPU usage, memory usage) and produce this data to the Kafka topic using the confluent-kafka-python library.

### FastAPI Endpoint for Data Consumption:

Create a FastAPI application with an endpoint that consumes data from the Kafka topic. You can use the confluent-kafka-python library to create a Kafka consumer.

Ingest data from Kafka, process it if necessary, and make it available through your FastAPI endpoint.

### Elasticsearch for Data Storage:
Set up an Elasticsearch index to store the monitoring data. Define a suitable index mapping that matches the structure of your data.

Modify your FastAPI application to index the incoming data into Elasticsearch. You can use the elasticsearch-py library for this.

### Kibana for Visualization:
Install and configure Kibana to connect to your Elasticsearch cluster.

Use Kibana to create visualizations and dashboards that display the monitoring data in real-time.
Explore Kibana's query and aggregation capabilities to create meaningful visualizations, such as line charts, bar charts, and tables.

### Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard:
Build a web-based dashboard using FastAPI to serve your Kibana visualizations and data. You can use FastAPI's WebSocket support for real-time updates.

Create a FastAPI WebSocket route that sends updated data to the dashboard as new data arrives from Kafka and is indexed into Elasticsearch.
Display the visualizations from Kibana on your dashboard and ensure they update in real-time as new data is received.

### Testing and Documentation:
Write unit tests for your FastAPI application, especially for data processing and Kafka integration.

Document your FastAPI endpoints, WebSocket routes, and any data processing logic.
Test the entire system to ensure data flows from data generation to visualization accurately.

### Deployment:
Deploy your FastAPI application, Elasticsearch, and Kibana on a server or cloud platform of your choice. Make sure they are accessible to users who need to view the monitoring dashboard.

### Monitoring and Logging:
Implement monitoring and logging for your application and the various components. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana can be helpful for monitoring Kafka, Elasticsearch, and FastAPI.
